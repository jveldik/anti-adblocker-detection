x Make a crawler with adblocker that spots the visible anti adblockers by reading the text
o Save the sites that use anti adblockers
o Search which scripts detect the adblockers
o Train a model on detecting these sort of scripts
o Make a second crawler that detects all anti adblockers by using the model
o If a site uses an anti adblocker visit the website again without an adblocker and detect the differences

o End result will be a list of sites with two fields:
    -   URL
    -   Anti adblocker usage
